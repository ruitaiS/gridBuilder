create three state button

create some kind of way to track the values at each button

create some kind of way to generate the grid

!!basically I need some way to access and tweak the values of an HTMl elemetn from within JS; like with each button press, I'd like to be able to alter the class of that button, and I would like to be able to pass the class of the button as a value.

I'd also like to be able to generate the buttons themselves in JS; this however might just be a matter of creating some divs and copy-pasting the innerHTML's of the buttons into them?

Will need to plan this out on paper
